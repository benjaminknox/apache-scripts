# Apache Scripts
This is a collection of Apache scripts that I have found very useful.

1) Webdav Apache script - creates a writeable file share
    - webdav.conf
2) A Simple Local Proxy - creates a proxy to an app being hosted on a localhost port 
    - simple-local-port-proxy.conf
3) A Mastodon Apache Proxy - creates a proxy to a dockerized mastodon being hosted on a localhost port 
    - mastodon.conf
    - https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon
4) A proxy to rancher - creates a proxy to rancher with SSL installed
    - rancher-proxy-ssl.conf
    - https://rancher.com/
